The examples / labs are clear, and the use of Google Colaboratory in the Doom section is incredibly clever - saves a lot of fuss. Thanks for keeping this course up to date, as I bought it quite long time ago, but did not have the drive to this earlier.

Also, the anaconda packages gave me newer versions of the libraries needed, and the general solution given was \"downgrade your package\". I could never get the second module to even run because the doom package they use is really out of date.

Besides they do not explain why they use given project architecture - on higher level of abstraction (i.e. how files, classes & methods interconnect) and most importantly, they do not experiment with parameters in the code to show how they influence the behavior of the AI (number of layer in NN, level of rewards, temperature, number of inputs etc.).

There has to be a dedicated section where you explain the very basics of pytorch by simply building an ANN. Also in parts 2 and 3(DOOM, A3C) the installation steps do not work. In order to get some packages working it is required to downgrade them(which is not specified) and whatever I tried I could not get DOOM working on Ubuntu.

I would recommend taking their Deep Learning course first because that will give an in depth explanation of neural networks, and then this AI course provides the knowledge about taking that neural network's output and using it as a brain to make decisions that something else can actuate. Neural Networks are amazing but seeing their results manifesting in a game rather than just numbers on the screen definitely takes it to the next level. While they didn't go into the maths behind it in much detail, instead referencing papers, I actually prefer that because there's so much detail already published in papers. There's no point just reproducing it. Instead this course distills that detail into intuition explanations and working programs that you can use today, so it's a great bridge between learning it as a beginner and following up by reading the papers yourself. Great job again guys."

Granted, that seemed rather complicated for a non-programmer but that's fine as the value for me was to see how the theory becomes reality.

It took me six hours to find a way for the self driving car's code to be functional, until I finally created a workaround to this problem by using a virtual machine with Ubuntu 18.04. The instructor responsible for the application portion of the course, has a difficult accent to understand, and gives long complicated explanations for what each line of code is doing, but you still do not understand what it is that it does despite listening to it several times. Through the application process, it doesn't feel like you are going through the \"development\" of the code. You are basically just copying the lines that he writes on the screen, without understanding what is going on, which is different than other courses I have taken where I can \"see\" how the application should be designed so that the goal is reached. In the self driving car section for example, you write the entire AI code without once testing it throughout the development process. In my opinion, this is not a good approach as we cannot see how the lines of code we are writing are actually going to affect its behavior. The biggest annoyance is that there feels like there is a disconnect between the theory portion and the application portion, as I was hoping that we would write our own neural network and AI from scratch, whereas you actually use PyTorch to do a lot of the \"behind the scenes\". I would only recommend this course for the AI theory, as there are some excellent explanations within those lectures about what is being discussed, and the referrals for supplementary material are also phenomenal."

And I think the thoroughness of explanations is probably more of a benefit to a large number of people who take this course. So my rating shouldn't be a general rating (they do explain things very well), just a testament to how the level of teaching meshes with my level of understanding, so I wish that part of the course would have moved along more quickly. On the other hand, I'm not as good at the actual coding, so I find the way they explain the code line by line amazing for my ability to understand and also be able to reproduce and build code of my own using the concepts that are covered. So far, I've gotten a lot out of this course (I'm still only half way through) and would definitely recommend it!

Everything is explained in detail and really designed to make beginners like myself feel comfortable.\nHowever, once I hit the practical part of the course, it made me feel as though I didn't belong there. Everything was very technical and going too quickly, forcing me to watch the videos several times and googling lots of terminology, despite taking detailed notes during the theory part of the course.\nI think the issue is that the project for the course (self driving car) is too complex for beginners. I understand, it's really cool and gets people enticed so people get to buy the course. But I think the practice part should first focus on smaller scale projects that allow complete beginners like myself to get more comfortable with the terminology and the content of the course, before moving on to more advanced projects."
